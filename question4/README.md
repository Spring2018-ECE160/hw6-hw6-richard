# Question 4

Using the point class that we used in clas, write a program that will compute 11 points of a quadratic curve in the form of ax^2+bx+c from -5 to 5. Prompt the user to input valuse for a, b, and c. Store these points in a struct array and print the points.

Provide at least 3 examples in the output below.

Compile Steps:

	gcc q4.c -o out4

Output:

	Enter values for a, b and c in the form a,b,c. No spaces:1,1,0
	Pt #1 is (-5, 20)
	Pt #2 is (-4, 12)
	Pt #3 is (-3, 6)
	Pt #4 is (-2, 2)
	Pt #5 is (-1, 0)
	Pt #6 is (0, 0)
	Pt #7 is (1, 2)
	Pt #8 is (2, 6)
	Pt #9 is (3, 12)
	Pt #10 is (4, 20)
	Pt #11 is (5, 30)
