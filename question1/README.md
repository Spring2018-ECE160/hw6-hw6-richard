## Question 1

Write a funciton that determines the maximum and minimum values from a one-dimensional array. Assume that the corresponding function prototype statement is

<code>void ranges(int x[], int npts, int *max_ptr, int *min_ptr)</code>

where npts contain the number of values in array x, and max_ptr and min_ptr are pointers to the variables in which to store the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Provide and print out 3 examples to show that your function is working as intended.

Compile Steps: 

	gcc q1.c -o out1

Output:

	Min value: 1, Max Value: 3
	Min value: 2, Max Value: 5
	Min value: 2, Max Value: 3
